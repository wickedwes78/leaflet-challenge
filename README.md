## Description
_Module 15 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data ([sourced here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)) . They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

I have based my Earthquake map on all earthquakes over the last seven days.  This is live data and the map will update regularly during the day. The map is setup to be centralised over Australasia as that is the area I live in and am interested in. You may move and zoom the map to any area of the world to see the earthquakes for the preceeding seven days.

An interesting fact about earthquakes is that an earthquake with a negative magnitude is possible.  These earthquakes are detected because of the ground motion and distance, and how sensitive seismographs have become. An earthquake of negative magnitude is a very small earthquake that is not felt by humans.  Further details can be found at the [Seismology Research Centre](https://www.src.com.au/negative-magnitude-earthquakes/).

The negative magnitudes have been included on the map as earthquakes with magnitude of 0 due to them still occuring.
