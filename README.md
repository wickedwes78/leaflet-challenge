## Description
_Module 15 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_



An interesting fact about earthquakes is that an earthquake with a negative magnitude is possible.  These earthquakes are detected because of the ground motion and distance, and how sensitive seismographs have become. An earthquake of negative magnitude is a very small earthquake that is not felt by humans.  Further details can be found at the [Seismology Research Centre](https://www.src.com.au/negative-magnitude-earthquakes/).

The negative magnitudes have been included on the map as earthquakes with magnitude of 0 due to them still occuring.
